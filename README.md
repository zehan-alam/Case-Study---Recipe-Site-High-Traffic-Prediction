# Case Study - Recipe Site High Traffic Prediction
In this project, conducted as part of my DataCamp Professional Data Scientist certification exam, I analyzed traffic data for a recipe website to enhance its homepage visibility. The goal was to utilize binary classification models, specifically Logistic Regression and Linear SVM, to predict which recipes would generate high traffic. This prediction aimed to increase website traffic, thereby boosting subscriptions and overall revenue. The project involved a thorough validation and cleaning process of the data, exploratory analysis with various visualizations, and the development and evaluation of the chosen models. For detailed analysis, refer to the `notebook.ipynb` file and the presentation available in `Certification - Data Scientist - Recipe Site Traffic.pptx`.
